# gpcr_ligand_py
This repo contains the scripts used to reproduce to the study "GPCR_LigandClassify.py; a rigorous machine learning classifier for GPCR targeting compounds". It features data cleaning, featurization, and machine learning model development. The functions used to perform machine learning development can be found in _custom_funcs.py_. The full study can be found at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-88939-5



To run _data_cleaning.py_ you must download the 'gpcr_ligands.tsv', 'interactions_active.tsv', and 'targets.tsv' files from the GLASS database at
